# MVVMC

I created MVVMC Xcode template.
To use this template :
First, we need to navigate to where Xcode stores its templates. In Finder, press Cmd+Shift+G to bring up the “Go to the folder…” prompt, and enter in this path: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/.

If you end up in a folder called “Templates”, you’re good to go. If you end up in a folder called “Xcode” it means you don’t have a Templates folder yet, so the first step is to create one: right-click in the window, choose New Folder, name it Templates, then navigate into it.

After that decompress zip file and copy mvvmc folder and put it into Templates folder, when you open xcode you will see MVVMC Template .
